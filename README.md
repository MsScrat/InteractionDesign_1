# Rainydays - Interaction Design
Rainydays was my cross-course project and the first design I made. This website is an updated version of that.  

## Build with
- HTML
- CSS

## Description 

### Task and idea

The task was to update the Rainydays website I had developed for the cross-course project.   
I however, took on to much and made a whole new website with a whole new design.  
Due to this choice, the website is half-finished, but significantly better within vitiual and interaction design. 

## Result
It was a poor choice to re-design the whole website, though I am very happy with the new design compared.
